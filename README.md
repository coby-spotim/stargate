# Stargate

A Fast Webserver written in Elixir and Erlang.

## Status

Currently, this is very much in alpha. I've taken the great work done by @van163 and am cleaning it up a bit by adding more Elixir structure to the project, so that it can be easily used by everyone.

## Current Features
- Simple support for HTTP (No HTTP/2)
- SSL
- Websockets
  - Partially implemented
